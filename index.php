            <p><strong>I am a web developer from Chelmsford, Essex. <span class="desktop inline">That's me, playing the guitar there.</span></strong></p>
            <p>With years of commercial experience under my belt, I've built a variety of sites for a variety of different companies: From small landing pages for insurance brokers, to fully dynamic Wordpress sites. I treat no two jobs the same, and constantly push the limits of what I know to deliver a better result each time.</p>
            <p>Every website I build is fully responsive and optimised for mobile devices. Using grid systems such as Bootsrap 3, Skeleton Grid and Boilerplate, I ensure that no matter what device you view my work on, content will be laid out and prioritised to ensure a seamless user journey.</p>
            <p>I've had a lot of practise using Wordpress to create themes or edit pre-existing 'premium themes' to create fully dynamic sites that are easily editable and maintainable.</p>

            <p class="desktop">I have been practising parkour and free running for a number of years. Parkour is the art of movement and overcoming obstacles in a fluid and efficient way. It has given me the oppertunity to take part in photoshoots, displays, workshops and classes as well as introduced me to a wealth of amazing people, most of whom have gone on to become my closest friends.</p>
            <p class="desktop">Other hobbies of mine include rock climbing, bouldering, skateboarding and surfing</p>
            <p class="desktop">I’ve been playing guitar since I was at college in 2007. I started off playing music by artists such as Green Day, Blink 182 and Sum 41 etc. Recently however, I’ve been learning to more acoustic music like Ben Howard, Mumford and Sons and Jose Gonzalez.</p>

            <h1>My Work...</h1>
            <p><strong>Having worked in Web Development for over 3 years, I’ve worked on a variety of sites; from small sites for start-up buisinesses, to fully dynamic wordpress sites. Below is a selection of sites that I am particularly proud of.</strong></p>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <h2>Charlie's Wedding</h2>
            <p>A friend of mine recently asked me to design a website with all of the information for his upcoming wedding. I provided him with a design, and he loved it. So I built it and it can be visited <a href="http://www.danfulcher.co.uk/wedding" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I was provided with a colour scheme of Mint Green and Navy Blue as well as a list of information about the wedding. I was also asked to include information about local accomodation and to include a map showing the wedding and reception venues.</p>
            <p>This was one of the first design projects I had worked on in a while as I mainly work with development. Initially I was worried that I might be rusty, but once the design got underway I had fun and am really pleased with the finished site.</p>

            <h2>Go Sporting</h2>
            <p>One of my latest projects to go live is Go Sporting. This is an online store selling discounted sporting activities across the UK. The theme is coded in-house and uses WooCommerce.</p>
            <p>This was my first e-commerce site. I found it interesting working with Woocommerce and finding out what it can do and implementing it into the theme I was creating.</p>
            <p>There's a fairly complex filter system, in which the user can type in their postcode or select from a list of locations. The site will then display all activities within a given radius and arrange them in order of distance from said location.</p>
            <p>Once the customer has purchased an activity, they are sent an email with a dynamically gennerated code, which is also sent to the supplier. This is how they redeem their purchase when they arrive at the venue on the date booked.</p>

            <h2>Love My Classic</h2>
            <p>Love My Classic is a social hub for classic car enthusiasts. The site uses wordpress, and a theme I developed from scratch. I also worked closely with a team of plugin developers to make a bespoke facebook upload area for the site. This was so that users could upload pictures and stories to the site using facebook, leave comments and make the site a living, breathing forum.</p>
            <p>Posts could also be uploaded by the admin panel of Wordpress. I put a lot of work into making sure that certain categories displayed in the relevant areas of the site. This meant doing a lot of research into query strings and the wordpress codex.</p>
            <p>The finished site is very dynamic. The users have been regularly uploading posts from facebook and the admin panel, so the site is populated with pictures, articles and disussions. This feels great; to see a site that I put a lot of work into, taking off as it has. This is why Love My Classic is one of my favourite projects.</p>
