					<p class="cont-box-text">Hello, my name is Daniel Fulcher. I have been doing Web Design and Development since 2011, when I started my apprenticeship with Progressive Marketing. This is where I learnt the basics of Web Design. From creating eye-catching and accessible designs, to coding in html, css and jquery. I learnt how to use programs such as Photoshop, Fireworks, Illustrator, Dreamweaver and Notepad++.</br></br>
					<em>I am committed to my work, I enjoy what I do and like to spend time doing it. I am positive and enthusiastic and this shows in my work.</em> I believe that no two websites should be the same. Like every company, every website should be unique. That is why I put a lot of effort into making each of my designs stand out. I don't believe in templates and try to bring something new to every project that comes my way.</p>

					<h2 id="sub-title">About me...</h2>
					<p class="cont-box-text"><em></br>This little section here is full of stuff about me, so if you don't care, I suggest you skip this bit</em></br></br>
					I live in a small village about half an hour out of Chelmsford. I have lived there my whole life. It is called St. Lawrence Bay. There is no train station and the buses are rare, so I started learning to drive as soon as I was 17.</br>
					I attended Chelmsford College, studying for an OCR Extended Diploma in Media. During this course we learnt about a variety of possible careers within the media industry. Such as Film & TV, Print, Radio, Animation and New Media. It was in this course that I had my first taste of Web Design. We didn't do a lot, but after college I started looking into apprenticeships in Web Design and eventually got one working for Progressive Marketing.</br></br>
					I am also a musician. I started learning guitar while I was at college and since then have learnt bass, keyboard and singing. I have always enjoyed being creative, and enjoy the sense of achievement I get when I create something new. Both with music and design.</br>
					I enjoy learning songs by artists that I like as well as writing my own.</br></br>
					I am a practitioner of free running and parkour and have been doing it since 2007. I am in a free running group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seven-Free-Run/448814911824801" alt="Seven Freerun, facebook">Seven Freerun</a>, we train together as well as doing shows, coaching and making showreels.</br>
					I train regularly in places such as Chelmsford, Basildon, Southend-On-Sea, London and Burnham-On-Crouch.</br>
					I enjoy the freedom that comes with parkour, every practitioner brings something new to the sport and I enjoy training with others to gain inspiration and learn as well as share ideas. The parkour community is great. Everyone is nice and we all get along and help those who need it.</br>
					I also like that it encourages doing something with your body, something unique, something that before I would have thought impossible. I have gained a lot of confidence and feel that I have grown as a person since doing parkour. I enjoy that as much as the physical accomplishments.
